Usage:
  build-projects.sh <project>...
  Trigger build for all given projects and wait till all builds are successful.
  Project is identified with relative path to project's root directory from repository root.
  When one of build fail then exit with error message.
  Configurable with additional environment variables:
      BUILD_MAX_SECONDS - maximum time in seconds to wait for all builds (15 minutes by default)
      BUILD_CHECK_AFTER_SECONDS - delay between checking status of builds again (15 seconds by default)

  <project>       id of project to build
                  minimally one, can be multiple
