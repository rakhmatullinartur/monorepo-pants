# List all dependencies between projects.
# Poject is identified with relative path to project's root directory from repository root.
#
# Dependencies can be specified in text file where each line is path (from monorepo root) to other project.
# Default location of dependency file is in root dir of each project on path `.ci/dependencies.txt`.
# Location of dependency file can be changed by setting environment variable `CI_DEPENDENCIES_FILE`.
#
# There is a support for automatic discovery of dependencies for Gradle projects.
# Discovery is based on Gradle's `composite build` feature (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html).
# Dependency is defined by using `includeBuild` function in project build script.
#
# Outputs lines of tuples in format PROJECT1 PROJECT2 (separated by space),
# where PROJECT1 depends on PROJECT2.
#
# Usage:
#   list-dependencies.sh
